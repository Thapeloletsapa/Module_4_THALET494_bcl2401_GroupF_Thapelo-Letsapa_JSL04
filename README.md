# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

"In this repository, I demonstrated the use of the ternary operator to provide concise, readable conditional logic. The following challenges are included:

- Challenge 1: choosing a Monster Energy drink based on a user's preference

- Challenge 2: determining whether to restock the fridge based on the number of cans left

- Challenge 3: determining whether to consume a Monster Energy drink based on the time of day

- Challenge 4: determining whether a Monster Energy drink is the optimal temperature based on the current temperature

The code is written in JavaScript and is contained
** In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic.  
// they are used judiciously to maintain readability.
